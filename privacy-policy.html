							<h4>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
							<p><b>Information automatically collected</b></p>
							<p><i>In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our App.</i></p>

							<p>The information we collect includes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

								<li><i>Vital Interests:</i> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>

							<h4>3. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h4>
							<p><i>In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</i></p>

If you are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?" above), in and other countries.</p>
							<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
							
							<h4>4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h4>
							<p><i>In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</i></p>

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 30 days.</p>
							<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

							<h4>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
							<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
